5. Add death and restart functionality to the player
6. Reduce the number of enemies that can be spawned in a certain area
7. Add more visual indicators
8. Add visual effect for attack and make the attack area larger
9. Add visual indicators for what changes are made to the player, eg. "can jump higher"
10. New mechanisms:
* A basic level-up functionality is done, where the player can choose an ability to become stronger
* More boons are added
* A basic item shop is added
